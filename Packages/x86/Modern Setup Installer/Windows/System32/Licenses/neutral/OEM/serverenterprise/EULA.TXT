PACK 2

These license terms are an agreement between 
Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you 
live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please 
read them. They apply to the evaluation 
software named above, which includes the 
media on which you received it, if any. The 
terms also apply to any Microsoft

· updates,

· supplements,

· Internet-based services, and 

· support services

for this software, unless other terms 
accompany those items. If so, those terms 
apply.

By using the software, you accept these 
terms. If you do not accept them, do not use 
the software.

As described below, using some features also 
operates as your consent to the transmission 
of certain standard computer information for 
Internet-based services.

If you comply with these license terms, you 
have the rights below.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 

· You may install and use up to 4 copies of 
the software on your devices. You may use the 
software only to demonstrate and internally 
evaluate it.

· You may not use the software in a live 
operating environment unless Microsoft 
permits you to do so under another agreement.

2. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft 
provides Internet-based services with the 
software. It may change or cancel them at any 
time.

a. Consent for Internet-Based Services. The 
software features described below connect to 
Microsoft or service provider computer 
systems over the Internet. In some cases, you 
will not receive a separate notice when they 
connect. You may switch off these features or 
not use them. For more information about 
these features, see <http://go.microsoft.
com/fwlink/?linkid=38670>. By using these 
features, you consent to the transmission of 
this information. Microsoft does not use the 
information to identify or contact you.

i. Computer Information. The following 
features use Internet protocols, which send 
to the appropriate systems computer 
information, such as your Internet protocol 
address, the type of operating system, 
browser and name and version of the software 
you are using, and the language code of the 
device where you installed the software. 
Microsoft uses this information to make the 
Internet-based services available to you.

· Windows Update Feature. You may connect 
new hardware to the device where you 
installed the software. Your device may not 
have the drivers needed to communicate with 
that hardware. If so, the update feature of 
the software can obtain the correct driver 
from Microsoft and install it on your device. 
You can switch off this update feature.

· Web Content Features. Features in the 
software can retrieve related content from 
Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide 
the content, these features send to Microsoft 
the type of operating system, name and 
version of the software you are using, type 
of browser and language code of the device 
where you installed the software. Examples of 
these features are clip art, templates, 
online training, online assistance and 
Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web 
content features.

· Digital Certificates. The software uses 
digital certificates. These digital 
certificates confirm the identity of Internet 
users sending X.509 standard encrypted 
information. The software retrieves 
certificates and updates certificate 
revocation lists. These security features 
operate only when you use the Internet.

· Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update 
feature updates the list of trusted 
certificate authorities. You can switch off 
the Auto Root Update feature.

· Windows Media Digital Rights Management. 
Content owners use Windows Media digital 
rights management technology (WMDRM) to 
protect their intellectual property, 
including copyrights. This software and third 
party software use WMDRM to play and copy 
WMDRM-protected content. If the software 
fails to protect the content, content owners 
may ask Microsoft to revoke the software's 
ability to use WMDRM to play or copy 
protected content. Revocation does not affect 
other content. When you download licenses for 
protected content, you agree that Microsoft 
may include a revocation list with the 
licenses. Content owners may require you to 
upgrade WMDRM to access their content. 
Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will 
ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If 
you decline an upgrade, you will not be able 
to access content that requires the upgrade. 
You may switch off WMDRM features that access 
the Internet. When these features are off, 
you can still play content for which you have 
a valid license.

· Windows Media Player. When you use Windows 
Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for

· compatible online music services in your 
region;

· new versions of the player; and

· codecs if your device does not have the 
correct ones for playing content.

You can switch off this last feature. For 
more information, go to <http://go.microsoft.
com/fwlink/?LinkId=51331>.

· Windows Rights Management Services. The 
software contains a feature that allows you 
to create content that cannot be printed, 
copied or sent to others without your 
permission. You must connect to Microsoft to 
use this feature for the first time. Once a 
year, you must re-connect to Microsoft to 
update it. For more information, go to 
<http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?
LinkId=52646>. You may choose not to use this 
feature.

3. TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE. The software 
will stop running one hundred eighty days 
after you install it. You will not receive 
any other notice. You may not be able to 
access data used with the software when it 
stops running.

4. MANDATORY ACTIVATION. To prevent its 
unlicensed use, you will not be able to use 
the software if you do not activate it as 
described during installation. You can 
activate the software by Internet or 
telephone; Internet and telephone service 
charges may apply. Some changes to your 
computer components or the software may 
require you to reactivate the software. The 
software will remind you to activate until 
you do.

5. DATA STORAGE TECHNOLOGY. The server 
software includes data storage technology 
called Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine 
for Windows. Components of the server 
software use this technology to store data. 
You may not otherwise use or access this 
technology under this agreement.

6. Scope of License. The software is 
licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives 
you some rights to use the software. 
Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless 
applicable law gives you more rights despite 
this limitation, you may use the software 
only as expressly permitted in this agreement.
In doing so, you must comply with any 
technical limitations in the software that 
only allow you to use it in certain ways. You 
may not

· disclose the results of any benchmark 
tests of the software to any third party 
without Microsoft's prior written approval;

the software;

· reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble

software in the United States, Washington 
state law governs the interpretation of this

it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.
The laws of the state where you live govern 
all other claims, including claims under 
state consumer protection laws, unfair 
competition laws, and in tort.

acquired the software in any other country, 
the laws of that country apply.

12. Legal Effect. This agreement describes

party from whom you acquired the software. 
This agreement does not change your rights 
under the laws of your country if the laws of 
your country do not permit it to do so.

13. Disclaimer of Warranty. The software is 
licensed 'as-is.' You bear the risk of using 
it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, 
guarantees or conditions. You may have 
additional consumer rights under your local

liability, negligence, or other tort to the 
extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or 
should have known about the possibility of 
the damages. The above limitation or 
exclusion may not apply to you because your
