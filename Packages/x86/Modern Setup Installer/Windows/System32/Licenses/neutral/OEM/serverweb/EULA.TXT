individual or an entity), the end user ("Recipient"), and
Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft").  BY INSTALLING, COPYING OR
OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCT (AS DEFINED
BELOW), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY
OR USE THE PRODUCT.

MICROSOFT CORPORATION LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR
MICROSOFT WINDOWS SERVER 2003, WEB EDITION

Accompanying this Agreement is a pre-release copy of the
Microsoft product identified above, which may include software
(the "Software"), and related documentation and information
(collectively the "Product"). The Product is protected by
copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as
other intellectual property laws and treaties.  The Product is
licensed, not sold.

 1. GRANT OF LICENSE.  This Agreement grants Recipient the
    following rights provided that Recipient complies with all
    terms and conditions of this Agreement:

    (a) Microsoft may provide the Product accompanying this
    Agreement as a web-based download or on a CD-ROM. Microsoft
    grants to Recipient a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable,
    royalty-free license to install and use ten (10) copies of
    the executable code of the Product on computers
    residing on Recipient's premises, solely to test the
    product internally, test the compatibility of Recipient's
    application or other product(s) which operate in
    conjunction with the Product, and to evaluate the Product
    for the purpose of providing feedback thereon to Microsoft.
    The foregoing limit is aggregate and applies regardless
    of how many copies of the Product Recipient obtains from
    Microsoft.  If Recipient is downloading the Product from
    a Microsoft web site, Recipient may make one (1) additional
    copy of the Product onto a CD-ROM to exercise the rights
    granted above.  All other rights are reserved to Microsoft.
    Recipient shall not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign,
    or otherwise transfer any portion of the Product.
    Recipient may not reverse engineer, decompile or
    disassemble any portion of the Product, except and only to
    the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by
    applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.  Recipient
    may not use the Product in a live operating environment
    where it may be relied upon to perform in the same manner
    as a commercially released product or with data that has
    not been sufficiently backed up.  Recipient may not use the
    Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft
    and its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership
    rights to the Product, and this Agreement shall not be
    construed in any manner as transferring any rights of
    ownership or license to the Product or to the features or
    information therein, except as specifically stated herein.

    (b) Recipient agrees to provide to Microsoft reasonable
    suggestions, comments and feedback regarding the Product,
    including but not limited to usability, bug reports and
    test results, with respect to Product testing
    (collectively, "Feedback").  Recipient grants Microsoft,
    under all of Recipient's intellectual property and
    proprietary rights, the following worldwide, non-exclusive,
    perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, fully paid up rights:
    (1) to make, use, copy, modify, and create derivative works
    of, the Feedback as part of any Microsoft product,
    technology, service, specification or other documentation
    (collectively, "Microsoft Offerings"), (2) to publicly
    perform or display, import, broadcast, transmit,
    distribute, license, offer to sell, and sell, rent, lease
    or lend copies of the Feedback (and derivative works
    thereof) as part of any Microsoft Offering, (3) solely with
    respect to Recipient's copyright and trade secret rights,
    to sublicense to third parties the foregoing rights,
    including the right to sublicense to further third parties,
    and (4) to sublicense to third parties any claims of any
    patents owned or licensable by Recipient that are
    necessarily infringed by a third party product, technology
    or service that uses, interfaces, interoperates or
    communicates with the Feedback or portion thereof
    incorporated into a Microsoft product, technology or
    service. Further, Recipient warrants that Recipient's
    Feedback is not subject to license terms that will require,
    or claim to require, that any Microsoft Offering that
    incorporates any Feedback  (or any intellectual property
    therein) be licensed to any third party on specified terms.
    Due to the nature of the development work, Microsoft
    provides no assurance that any specific errors or
    discrepancies in the Product will be corrected.

    (c) Recipient's use of the Product shall take place solely at
    Recipient's site.  Recipient may not demonstrate or show
    the Product to third parties without the express written
    permission of Microsoft.

    (d) Recipient's use of software applications installed on or
    accessed through the Product's IntelliMirror, Terminal
    Services, or application-sharing functionality may require
    additional licenses - please consult the license agreement
    accompanying such software.

    (e) In the event Microsoft, in its sole discretion, elects to
    provide deliveries of Product to more than one individual
    employed by Recipient (if Recipient is not a single
    individual), each such recipient shall be entitled to
    exercise the rights granted in this Agreement, and shall
    be bound by the terms and conditions herein.

    (f) Mandatory Activation.  The license rights granted under
    this Agreement are limited to the first fourteen (14) days
    after Recipient first installs the Product unless Recipient
    supplies information required to activate Recipient's
    licensed copy in the manner described during the setup
    sequence of the Product.  Recipient can activate the
    Product through the use of the Internet or telephone; toll
    charges may apply.  Recipient may also need to reactivate
    the Product if Recipient modifies Recipient's computer
    hardware or alter the Product.  There are technological
    measures in this Product that are designed to prevent
    unlicensed or illegal use of the Product.   Recipient
    agrees that Microsoft may use those measures.

    (g) RECIPIENT'S RIGHT TO USE THE PRODUCT
    SHALL BE EFFECTIVE FROM THE DATE
    RECIPIENT FIRST INSTALLS THE PRODUCT
    ON ANY DEVICE FOR A PERIOD OF THREE
    HUNDRED SIXTY (360) DAYS.  THE PRODUCT
    IS TIME SENSITIVE AND WILL NOT FUNCTION
    UPON EXPIRATION OF THE 360 DAY PERIOD.
    NOTICE OF EXPIRATION WILL NOT ACTIVELY
    BE GIVEN, SO RECIPIENT NEEDS TO PLAN
    FOR THE EXPIRATION DATE AND MAKE A COPY
    OF AND REMOVE RECIPIENT'S IMPORTANT
    DATA BEFORE EXPIRATION.  If Recipient
    desires to use the Product after this Agreement has
    expired, Recipient will need to acquire a validly licensed
    copy of the commercial release version of the Product.

    (h) Internet-Based Services Components.  The Product contains
    components that enable and facilitate the use of certain
    Internet-based services.  Recipient acknowledges and agrees
    that Microsoft may automatically check the version of the
    Product and/or its components that Recipient is utilizing
    and may provide upgrades or fixes to the Product that will
    be automatically downloaded to your computer.

    (i) Security Updates.  Content providers are using the
    digital rights management technology ("Microsoft DRM")
    contained in this Product to protect the integrity of their
    content ("Secure Content") so that their intellectual property,
    including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated.
    Owners of such Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners")
    may, from time to time, request Microsoft to provide
    security related updates to the Microsoft DRM components
    of the Product ("Security Updates") that may affect
    Recipient's ability to copy, display and/or play Secure
    Content through Microsoft software or third party
    applications that utilize Microsoft DRM.  Recipient
    therefore agrees that, if Recipient elects to download a
    license from the Internet which enables Recipient's use of
    Secure Content, Microsoft may, in conjunction with such
    license, also download onto Recipient's computer such
    Security Updates that a Secure Content Owner has requested
    that Microsoft distribute.  Microsoft will not retrieve any
    personally identifiable information, or any other
    information, from Recipient's computer by downloading such
    Security Updates.

 2. TERM OF AGREEMENT.  The term of this Agreement shall
    commence on the date accepted by Recipient and shall
    continue until terminated by the first of the following
    events: (i) pursuant to Section 1(f) and/or 1(g) above;
    (ii) by Microsoft in writing at any time, with or without
    cause; or (iii) this Agreement will automatically terminate
    without notice upon the earlier of the commercial release
    version of the Software contained in the Product.  Upon the
    termination of this Agreement (or upon request by
    Microsoft), Recipient shall promptly return to Microsoft,
    or certify destruction of, all full or partial copies of
    the Product provided by Microsoft.  The following Sections
    shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement:
    Sections 1(b), 1(c), 6, 7, 8, and 9.

 3. COST OF TESTING.  There is no charge to Recipient for testing
    of the Product.  Microsoft shall bear all direct freight
    expenses relating to the shipment of the Product to
    Recipient's place of business and Recipient will pay any
    return freight expenses.

 4. PRODUCT MAINTENANCE/UPDATES.  Microsoft
    is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support
    or updates to Recipient for the Product provided to
    Recipient pursuant to this Agreement.  However, Microsoft
    may, in its sole discretion, provide further pre-release
    versions, technical support, updates and/or supplements of
    the Product and/or related information ("Updates") to
    Recipient hereunder, in which case such Updates shall also
    be deemed to be included in the "Product" and the
    "Software," and therefore governed by this Agreement,
    unless other terms of use are provided by Microsoft with
    such Updates.  In no event shall Microsoft be obligated to
    provide Recipient a copy of the commercial release version
    of the Product in connection with Recipient's participation
    in the testing program.  Microsoft is not obligated to make
    the Product commercially available.

 5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. All title
    and intellectual property rights in and to the Product
    (including but not limited to any images, photographs,
    animations, video, audio, music, text and "applets"
    incorporated into the Software), and any copies of the
    Product that Recipient is expressly permitted to make
    herein, are owned by Microsoft or its suppliers.  All title
    and intellectual property rights in and to the content
    which may be accessed through use of the Product are the
    property of the respective content owner and may be
    protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual
    property laws and treaties.  This Agreement grants
    Recipient no rights to use such content.  If the Product
    contains documentation which is provided only in electronic
    form, Recipient may print one copy of such electronic
    documentation.  Recipient may not copy the printed
    materials accompanying the Product.  All rights not
    expressly granted are reserved by Microsoft.

 6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  THE PRODUCT IS
    DEEMED ACCEPTED BY RECIPIENT.  THE
    PRODUCT CONTAINS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE
    AND MAY BE CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY BEFORE
    COMMERCIAL RELEASE.  TO THE MAXIMUM
    EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE
    PRODUCT AND SUPPORT SERVICES (IF ANY)
