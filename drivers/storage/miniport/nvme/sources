# -DDUMB_DRIVER:  Used ONLY FOR DEBUG.  Double buffers all IOs, handy for any debug
#              situation where control over all host side buffers is needed
#              (alingment issues, etc).  Be sure to step through before use,
#              doesn't get used/tested often!  Also disables:
#              - learning mode
#              - SGL-PRP xlation (our buffre addresses are known)
#              - multiple queues NUMA opimized (uses only one Q by faking single proc)

# -DCHATHAM2:  Required for use with Chatham2 (aka Chatsberg) hardware

# -DCOMPLETE_IN_DPC:  Controls whether IOs are completed in the ISR ot in DPCs

# -DHISTORY:  Enables history buffers for debug, can be used in free or checked build

# -DPRP_DBG:  dumps all PRP info for every IO
