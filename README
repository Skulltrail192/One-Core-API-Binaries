   One-Core-API is a compatibility layer to run native programs of XP/2003 and incompatible programs and designed for upper Windows
versions, like Windows Vista+. The One-Core-API's acrhitectures involves system dlls and compiled wrappers to "simulate" native dlls
like kernel32, user32.dll, shell32.dll and others. x64 versions also avaliable.
